.SH "NAME"
\fBlibconfini\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBlibconfini\fR is a simple INI parsing library with the ability to read disabled entries (i\.e\. valid entries nested in comments)\. \fBlibconfini\fR does not store the data read from an INI file, but rather dispatches it, formatted, to a custom listener\.
.
.P
The code is written in C (C99) and does not depend on any particular library, except for the C standard headers \fBstdio\.h\fR, \fBstdlib\.h\fR and \fBstdint\.h\fR\.
.
.P
If you want to start to learn directly from the code, you can find partially self\-documented sample usages of \fBlibconfini\fR under \fB/usr/share/doc/libconfini/examples/\fR\.
.
.SH "WHAT IS AN INI FILE?"
INI files were introduced with the early versions of Microsoft Windows, where the \.ini file name extension stood for INItialization\. An INI file can be considered as a string representation of a tree object, with new lines used as delimiters between nodes\. A typical INI file is a plain text file looking like the following example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# delivery\.conf

; general options

location = Colosseum
place = Rome

[sender]

name = John Smith
email = john\.smith@example\.com

[receiver]

name = Mario Rossi   # He\'s a big guy
email = mario\.rossi@example\.com
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "SUPPORTED SYNTAXES"
During the years several interpretations of INI files have appeared\. In some implementations the colon character (\fB:\fR) has been adopted as delimiter between keys and values instead of the classic equals sign (a typical example under GNU/Linux is \fB/etc/nsswitch\.conf\fR); in other implementations, under the influence of Unix standard configuration files, a sequence of one or more spaces (\fB/[ \et\ev\ef]+/\fR or \fB/(?:\e\e(?:\en\er?|\er\en?)|[\et \ev\ef])+/\fR) has been used instead (see for example \fB/etc/host\.conf\fR)\.
.
.P

.P
\fBlibconfini\fR has been born as a general INI parser for \fBGNU\fR, so the support of most part of INI dialects has been implemented within it\.
.
.P
Especially in Microsoft Windows a more radical syntax variation has been implemented: the use of semicolon, instead of new lines, as delimiter between nodes, as in the following example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# delivery\.conf

; general options

location=Colosseum;place=Rome;[sender] name=John Smith;
email=john\.smith@example\.com;
[receiver] name=Mario Rossi; # He\'s a big guy
email=mario\.rossi@example\.com
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
For several reasons the use of semicolon as node delimiter is not (and will never be) supported by \fBlibconfini\fR\.
.
.SS "KEYS"
A \fBkey\-value element\fR is identified as a string placed after a new line and followed by a key\-value delimiter – typically the equals sign (\fB=\fR) or the colon sign (\fB:\fR) or a space sequence (\fB/\es+/\fR) – which is followed by a value, which is followed by a new line or an inline comment\.
.
.P
Both the \fBkey part\fR and the \fBvalue part\fR may be enclosed within quotes (\fB\'\fR or \fB"\fR):
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

foo = \'bar\'
"hello" = world
"artist" = "Pablo Picasso"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The \fBkey part\fR can contain any character, except the delimiter (which may be enclosed within quotes for not beeing considered as such)\. In multi\-line formats internal new line sequences must be escaped (\fB/\e\e(?:\en\er?|\er\en?)/\fR)\.
.
.P
If the \fBkey part\fR part is missing \fBlibconfini\fR considers the element of \fIunknown type\fR (example: \fB= foo\fR)\. If the \fBvalue part\fR is missing the key element is considered empty (example: \fBfoo =\fR)\. If the delimiter is missing (and therefore the value part as well), according to some formats the key element is is considered to be an \fIimplicit key\fR – typically representing the boolean \fBtrue\fR (example: \fBfoo\fR)\. For instance, in the following example from \fB/etc/pacman\.conf\fR, \fBIgnorePkg\fR is an empty key, while \fBColor\fR is an implicit key representing a \fBtrue\fR boolean – i\.e\. \fBColor = YES\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

HoldPkg = pacman glibc
Architecture = auto
IgnorePkg =
Color
SigLevel = Required DatabaseOptional
LocalFileSigLevel = Optional
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The \fBvalue\fR part can contain typed data, usually: a boolean (booleans supported by \fBlibconfini\fR are: \fBFALSE\fR/\fBTRUE\fR, \fBNO\fR/\fBYES\fR, \fBOFF\fR/\fBON\fR – case insensitive), a string, a number, or an array (typically with commas or spaces as delimiters between members – examples: \fBpaths = /etc, /usr, "/home/john/Personal Data"\fR or \fBpaths = /etc /usr "/home/john/Personal Data"\fR)\. In multi\-line formats internal new line sequences must be escaped (\fB/\e\e(?:\en\er?|\er\en?)/\fR)\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

[my_section]

my_string = "Hello world"
\'my_number\' = 42
my_boolean = NO
my_implicit_boolean
my_array = Asia, Africa, \'North America\', South America, \e
           Antarctica, Europe, Australia
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "SECTIONS"
A \fBsection\fR can be imagined as a directory\. A \fBsection path\fR is identified as the string \fB"$1"\fR in the regular expression \fB/(?:^|\en|\er)[ \et\ev\ef]*\e[[ \et\ev\ef]*([^\e]]*)[ \et\ev\ef]*\e][ \et\ev\ef]*(?:\en|\er|$)/\fR globally applied to an INI file\. A section path expresses nesting using the “dot” character, as in the following example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

[section]

foo = bar

[section\.subsection]

foo = bar
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
A section path starting with a dot expresses nesting to the previous section\. Hence the last example is equivalent to:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

[section]

foo = bar

[\.subsection]

foo = bar
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Keys appearing before any section path belong to a virtual \fIroot\fR node (with an empty string as path), as the key \fBfoo\fR in the following example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

foo = bar

[options]

interval = 3600

[host]

address = 127\.0\.0\.1
port = 80
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Section parts may be enclosed within quotes:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

["world"\.europe\.\'germany\'\.berlin]

foo = bar
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "COMMENTS"
Comments are string segments enclosed within the sequence \fB/(?:^|\es)[;#]/\fR and a new line sequence, as in the following example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# this is a comment

foo = bar       # this is an inline comment

; this is another comment
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Comments may in theory be multi\-line, following the same syntax of multi\-line disabled entries (see below)\. This is usually of little utility, except for inline comments you want to make sure will refer to the previous entry:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

play1 = The Tempest

play2 = Twelfth Night # If music be the food of love, play on;      \e
                      # Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting,     \e
                      # The appetite may sicken, and so die\.        \e
                      # That strain again; it had a dying fall:     \e
                      # O, it came oer my ear, like the sweet sound \e
                      # That breathes upon a bank of violets,       \e
                      # Stealing, and giving odour! Enough! No more\.\e
                      # \'Tis not so sweet now as it was before\.     \e
                      #                                             \e
                      #     Orsino, scene I

# This is also a masterpiece!
play3 = The Merchant of Venice
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "DISABLED ENTRIES"
A disabled entry is either a section or a key that has been nested inside a comment as its only child\. Inline comments cannot represent disabled entries\. According to some formats disabled entries can be multi\-line, using \fB/\e\e(?:\en\er?|\er\en?)[\et \ev\ef]*[;#]/\fR as multi\-line escape sequence\. For example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

#this = is\e
 #a\e
    #multi\-line\e
#disabled\e
  #entry
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "ESCAPE SEQUENCES"
In order to maximize the flexibility of the data, only four escape sequences are supported by \fBlibconfini\fR: \fB\e\'\fR, \fB\e"\fR, \fB\e\e\fR and the multi\-line escape sequence (\fB/\e\e(?:\en\er?|\er\en?)/\fR)\.
.
.P
The first three escape sequences are left untouched by all functions except \fBini_string_parse()\fR and \fBini_unquote()\fR (see below)\. Nevertheless, the characters \fB\'\fR, \fB"\fR and \fB\e\fR can determine different behaviors during the parsing depending on whether they are escaped or unescaped\. For instance, the string \fBjohnsmith !"\fR in the following example will not be parsed as a comment:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

[users\.jsmith]

comment = "hey! have a look at my hashtag #johnsmith !"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
A particular case of escape sequence is the multi\-line escape sequence (\fB/\e\e(?:\en\er?|\er\en?)/\fR), which in multi\-line INI files gets \fIimmediately unescaped by \fBlibconfini\fR\fR\.

.SS "HOW IT WORKS"
The function \fBload_ini_path()\fR is a clone of \fBload_ini_file()\fR that requires a path instead of a \fBFILE\fR handle\.
.
.P
Both functions \fBload_ini_file()\fR and \fBload_ini_path()\fR dynamically allocate at once the whole INI file into the heap, and the two structures \fBIniStatistics\fR and \fBIniDispatch\fR into the stack\. All members of the INI file are then dispatched to the custom listener \fBf_foreach()\fR\. Finally the allocated memory gets automatically freed\.
.
.P
Because of this mechanism \fIit is very important that all the dispatched data be \fBimmediately\fR copied by the user (when needed), and no pointers to the passed data be saved\fR: after the end of the functions \fBload_ini_file()\fR / \fBload_ini_path()\fR all the allocated data will be destroyed indeed, and each dispatch might furthermore overwrite data from previous dispatches\.
.
.P
Within a dispatching cycle, the structure containing each dispatch (\fBIniDispatch * dispatch\fR) is always the same \fBstruct\fR that gets constantly updated with new information\.
.
.SS "PARSING A BUFFER INSTEAD OF A FILE"
Starting from version 1\.10\.0, it is possible to parse a disposable buffer containing an INI file instead of a physical file (i\.e\., to parse a \fBchar\fR array)\. The function that allows to do so is named \fBstrip_ini_cache()\fR\. This function presents some important differences when compared to \fBload_ini_file()\fR and \fBload_ini_path()\fR:
.
.IP "1." 4
As the name suggests, the buffer passed is not left untouched, but gets tokenized and rearranged instead – if you want to keep the original buffer you must pass a copy of it to \fBstrip_ini_cache()\fR – you can use \fBstrndup()\fR for this, or use the example below
.
.IP "2." 4
No memory is freed after the dispatching cycle is over: getting rid of the disposable buffer is something that must be done manually
.
.IP "3." 4
The strings dispatched are all tokens from the buffer passed as argument (no new memory is ever allocated), but the existence of each token is granted only for a short time, that is \fIuntil the dispatch of the next node\fR (in fact the latter may overwrite previous information) – therefore, as with \fBload_ini_file()\fR and \fBload_ini_path()\fR, every needed information must be copied immediately with each dispatch
.
.IP "4." 4
After the dispatching cycle is over, the buffer passed as argument must be regarded as \fIunreliable information\fR (portions of it might have been repeatedly overwritten and corrupted by subsequent dispatches)
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
In short, \fBstrip_ini_cache()\fR works exactly like \fBload_ini_file()\fR and \fBload_ini_path()\fR, but with the difference that the former destroys the input while it dispatches it\. And of course the input is not anymore a file, but a disposable buffer instead\. As a matter of fact, \fBstrip_ini_cache()\fR is the main parsing function both \fBload_ini_file()\fR and \fBload_ini_path()\fR rely on in order to dispatch the content of an INI file\. For a sample usage, please see \fBexamples/topics/strip_ini_cache\.c\fR\.
.
.P
If you want to automatize the process of making a copy of a read\-only buffer, strip and parse the copy, then free the allocated memory, you can use the following function:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

/*  examples/utilities/load_ini_buffer\.h  */

#include <stdio\.h>
#include <string\.h>
#include <confini\.h>

) {

  char * const ini_cache = strndup(ini_buffer, ini_length);

  if (!ini_cache) {

    return CONFINI_ENOMEM;

  }

  const int retval = strip_ini_cache(
    ini_cache,
    ini_length,
    format,
    f_init,
    f_foreach,
    user_data
  );

  free(ini_cache);

  return retval;

}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0

.fi
.
.IP "" 0

Since in most cases an INI buffer \fIis\fR a disposable buffer (unless one wants to parse the very same buffer more than once), \fBlibconfini\fR\'s interface does not include the function in the example above\.
.
.SH "THE `IniFormat` DATA TYPE"
For a correct use of this library it is fundamental to understand the \fBIniFormat\fR data type\. \fBlibconfini\fR has been born as a general INI parser, with the main purpose of \fIbeing able to understand INI files written by other programs\fR (see \fBRationale\fR), therefore some flexibility was required\. When an INI file is parsed it is parsed according to a particular format\. The \fBIniFormat\fR data type is a univocal description of such format\. It is implemented as a 24\-bit bitfield\. Its small size (3 bytes) allows it to be passed by value to the functions that require it\.

The function \fBini_fton()\fR tells us that this format is univocally the format No\. 56637\. The function \fBini_ntof()\fR gives us then a shortcut to construct the very same format using its format number\. Hence, the code above corresponds to:

When the functions \fBload_ini_file()\fR, \fBload_ini_path()\fR read an INI file, or when the function \fBstrip_ini_cache()\fR parses a buffer, they dispatch the file content to the \fBf_foreach()\fR listener\. Before the dispatching begins some statistics about the parsed file can be dispatched to the \fBf_init()\fR listener (if this is non\-\fBNULL\fR)\.
.
.P
The information passed to \fBf_init()\fR is passed through an \fBIniStatistics\fR structure, while the information passed to \fBf_foreach()\fR is passed through an \fBIniDispatch\fR structure\.
.
.SH "RENDERING"
The output strings dispatched by \fBlibconfini\fR follow some formatting rules depending on their role within the INI file\. First, multi\-line escape sequences will be unescaped, then
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBKey names\fR will be rendered according to ECMAScript \fBkey_name\.replace(/^[\en\er]\es*|\es+/g, " ")\fR – within single or double quotes, if active, the text will be rendered verbatim\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBSection paths\fR, if format supports nesting, will be rendered according to ECMAScript \fBsection_name\.replace(/\e\.*\es*$|(?:\es*(\e\.))+\es*|^\es+/g, "$1")\.replace(/\es+/g, " ")\fR – within single or double quotes, if active, the text will be rendered verbatim – otherwise, will be rendered according to the same algorithm used for key names\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBValues\fR, if \fBformat\.do_not_collapse_values\fR is active, will only be cleaned of spaces at the beginning and at the end; otherwise will be rendered according to the same algorithm used for key names (with the difference that, if \fBformat\.preserve_empty_quotes\fR is set to \fBtrue\fR, empty quotes surrounded by spaces will be preserved)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBComments\fR, in multi\-line formats, will be rendered according to ECMAScript \fBcomment_string\.replace(/(^|\en\er?|\er\en?)[ \et\ev\ef]*[#;]+/g, "$1")\fR; elsewhere, according to ECMAScript \fBcomment_string\.replace(/^[ \et\ev\ef]*[#;]+/, "")\fR\.
.

\fBUnknown nodes\fR will be rendered verbatim\.
.

.P
The strings dispatched, as already said, must not be freed\. \fINevertheless, before being copied or analyzed they can be edited, \fBwith some precautions\fR\fR:
.
.IP "1." 4
Be sure that your edit remains within the buffer lengths given (see \fBIniDispatch::d_len\fR and \fBIniDispatch::v_len\fR)\.
.
.IP "2." 4
If you want to edit the content of \fBIniDispatch::data\fR and this contains a section path, the \fBIniDispatch::append_to\fR properties of its children may share this buffer\. In this case, if you edit its content, you can no more rely on the \fBIniDispatch::append_to\fR properties of this node\'s children (you will not make any damage, the loop will continue just fine: so if you think you are never going to use the property \fBIniDispatch::append_to\fR just do it); alternatively, use \fBstrndup()\fR\. If, instead, \fBIniDispatch::data\fR contains a key name or a comment, it is granted that no other dispatch will share this buffer, so feel free to edit it before it gets lost\.
.
.IP "3." 4
Regarding \fBIniDispatch::value\fR, if it does not represent an implicit value (see below), this buffer is never shared between dispatches, so feel free to edit it\.
.
.IP "4." 4
Regarding \fBIniDispatch::append_to\fR, this buffer is likely to be shared with other dispatches\. Again, you would not destroy the world nor generate errors, but you would make the next \fBIniDispatch::append_to\fRs useless\. For this reason \fBthe buffer pointed by \fBIniDispatch::append_to\fR is passed as constant\fR\. To unquote the path parts listed in this field please use \fBstrndup()\fR\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Typical peaceful edits are the ones obtained by calling the functions \fBini_array_collapse()\fR and \fBini_string_parse()\fR directly on the buffer \fBIniDispatch::value\fR – but make sure that you are not going to edit the global string \fBINI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_VALUE\fR, if used (see below):

.SS "STRING COMPARISONS"
In order to perform comparisons between strings the functions \fBini_string_match_ss()\fR, \fBini_string_match_si()\fR, \fBini_string_match_ii()\fR and \fBini_array_match()\fR are available\. The function \fBini_string_match_ss()\fR compares two simple strings, the function \fBini_string_match_si()\fR compares a simple string with an unparsed INI string, the function \fBini_string_match_ii()\fR compares two unparsed INI strings, and the function \fBini_array_match()\fR compares two INI arrays\. INI strings are the strings typically dispatched by \fBload_ini_file()\fR, \fBload_ini_path()\fR or \fBstrip_ini_cache()\fR which may contain quotes and the three escape sequences \fB\e\e\fR, \fB\e\'\fR, \fB\e"\fR\. Simple strings are user\-given strings or the result of \fBini_string_parse()\fR\.
.
.P
As a consequence, the functions \fBini_string_match_si()\fR, \fBini_string_match_ii()\fR and \fBini_array_match()\fR do not perform literal comparisons of equality between strings\. For example, in the following (absurd) INI file the two keys \fBfoo\fR and \fBhello\fR belong to the same section named \fBthis is a double quotation mark: "!\fR (after being parsed by \fBini_string_parse()\fR)\.
.

In formats that support quotes, the function \fBini_array_match()\fR is also the function that should be used, with \fB\'\.\'\fR or \fBINI_DOT\fR as delimiter (see \fBenum\fR \fBIniDelimiters\fR), to properly compare section paths containing more than one level of nesting\.

.P
The four functions \fBini_string_match_ss()\fR, \fBini_string_match_si()\fR, \fBini_string_match_ii()\fR, \fBini_array_match()\fR perform case\-sensitive or case\-insensitive comparisons depending on the format given\. UTF\-8 codepoints out of the ASCII range are always compared case\-sensitive\.
.
.P
Note that within INI strings empty quotes and spaces out of quotes are always collapsed during comparisons\. Furthermore, remember that the multi\-line escape sequence \fB/\e\e(?:\en\er?|\er\en?)/\fR is \fInot\fR considered as such in INI strings, since this is the only escape sequence automatically unescaped by \fBlibconfini\fR \fIbefore\fR each dispatch\.

Once your listener starts to receive the parsed data you may want to format and better parse the \fBvalue\fR part of key elements\. The following functions might be useful for this purpose:

.
.SS "FORMATTING THE KEY NAMES"
The function \fBini_unquote()\fR can be useful for key names enclosed within quotes\. This function is very similar to \fBini_string_parse()\fR, except that does not bother collapsing the sequences of more than one space that might result from removing empty quotes – this is never necessary, since empty quotes surrounded by spaces in key and section names are always collapsed before being dispatched\.
.
.P
You could use \fBini_string_parse()\fR as well to parse key and section names, but you would obtain the same result with a slightly bigger effort from the CPU\.
.
.SS "FORMATTING THE SECTION PATHS"
In order to retrieve the parts of a section path, the functions \fBini_array_get_length()\fR, \fBini_array_foreach()\fR, \fBini_array_break()\fR, \fBini_array_release()\fR, \fBini_array_shift()\fR and \fBini_array_split()\fR can be used with \fB\'\.\'\fR or \fBINI_DOT\fR as delimiter (see \fBenum\fR \fBIniDelimiters\fR)\. Note that section paths dispatched by \fBlibconfini\fR are \fIalways\fR collapsed arrays, therefore calling the function \fBini_array_collapse()\fR on them will have no effects\.
.
.P
It might be required that the function \fBini_unquote()\fR be applied to each part of a section path, depending on the content and the format of the INI file\.
.
.SS "IMPLICIT KEYS"
In order to set the value to assign to implicit keys (i\.e\. keys without a delimiter and a value), please use the \fBini_global_set_implicit_value()\fR function\. A \fIzero\-length \fBTRUE\fR boolean\fR is usually a good choice:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

ini_global_set_implicit_value("YES", 0);
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Alternatively, instead of \fBini_global_set_implicit_value()\fR you can manually declare at the beginning of your code the two global variables \fBINI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_VALUE\fR and \fBINI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_V_LEN\fR, which will be retrieved by \fBlibconfini\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

#include <confini\.h>

char * INI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_VALUE = "YES";
size_t INI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_V_LEN = 3;
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Or you can assign a value to them at the beginning of the \fBmain()\fR function of your program:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

#include <confini\.h>

int main () {

  INI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_VALUE = "YES";
  INI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_V_LEN = 3;

  /* \.\.\. */

}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If not defined elsewhere, these variables are initialized respectively to \fBNULL\fR and \fB0\fR by default\.
.
.P
The two variables \fBINI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_VALUE\fR and \fBINI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_V_LEN\fR may be set to any arbitrary values\. In fact these will not be parsed or analyzed anywhere by \fBlibconfini\fR, they are only used as placeholders for custom information accessible solely by the user\.
.
.P
After having set the value to be assigned to implicit key elements, and having enabled \fBIniFormat::implicit_is_not_empty\fR in the format, it is possible to test whether a dispatched key is implicit or not by comparing the address of its \fBvalue\fR property with the global variable \fBINI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_VALUE\fR:

The functions \fBload_ini_file()\fR, \fBload_ini_path()\fR, \fBstrip_ini_cache()\fR, \fBini_array_foreach()\fR and \fBini_array_split()\fR require some listeners defined by the user\. Such listeners must return an \fBint\fR value\. When this is non\-zero the caller function is interrupted, its loop stopped, and a non\-zero value is returned by the caller as well\.
.
.P
The functions \fBload_ini_file()\fR, \fBload_ini_path()\fR and \fBstrip_ini_cache()\fR return a non\-zero value also if the INI file, for any reason, has not been completely parsed (see \fBenum\fR \fBConfiniInterruptNo\fR)\. Therefore, in order to be able to distinguish between internal errors and user\-generated interruptions the mask \fBCONFINI_ERROR\fR can be used\.

For instance, in the following example the \fBf_foreach()\fR listener returns a non\-zero value if a key named \fBpassword\fR with a value that equals \fBHello world\fR is found\.

.P
A function\-like macro named \fBINIFORMAT_HAS_NO_ESC()\fR is available in order to check whether a format supports escape sequences or not\.
.
.SS "STORING THE DISPATCHED DATA"
In order to be as flexible as possible, \fBlibconfini\fR does not store the dispatched data, nor indicizes them\. This gives the developer the power to deal with them in many different ways\.
.
.P
For small INI files a normal \fBif\fR/\fBelse\fR chain, using \fBini_array_match()\fR for comparing section paths and \fBini_string_match_si()\fR/\fBini_string_match_ii()\fR for comparing key names, usually represents the most practical way to obtain the information required from an INI file\.
.
.P
Sometimes however, especially in case of sizeable INI files, the most efficient solution would be to store the parsed data in a hash table before trying to access it\.
.
.P
Some INI parsers are released with a hash table API included by default\. This is often an unpractical solution, since fantastic free software libraries that focus solely on hash tables already exist, and providing a further API for managing a hash function together with an INI parser only complicates the code, makes it harder to maintain, and does not give the user the real freedom to choose what suits best to each single case\.
.
.P
When a user needs it, the data parsed by \fBlibconfini\fR can still be stored in a third\-party hash table while it is being dispatched\. By doing so the resulting performance will equal that of an INI parser with a hash table included by default, since the only job of \fBlibconfini\fR is that of scrolling the content of an INI file linearly from the beginning to the end – and there are not more efficient ways to parse and indicize the content of a serialized tree\.
.
.P
If you are interested in combining \fBlibconfini\fR with a hash table, I have left a general example of how to use \fBGLib\fR\'s \fBGHashTable\fR together with \fBlibconfini\fR under \fBexamples/miscellanea/glib_hash_table\.c\fR\. By keeping this example as a model other solutions can be easily explored as well\.
.
.SS "SIZE OF THE DISPATCHED DATA"
Within an INI file it is granted that if one sums together all the \fB(disp\->d_len + 1)\fR and all the \fB(disp\->v_len > 0 ? disp\->v_len + 1 : 0)\fR received, the result will always be less\-than or equal\-to \fB(stats\->bytes + 1)\fR – where \fB+ 1\fR represents the NUL terminators and \fBdisp\fR and \fBstats\fR are respectively the \fBIniDispatch\fR and \fBIniStatistics\fR structures passed as arguments to the callback functions\. \fBIf one adds to this also all the \fBdisp\->at_len\fR properties, or if the \fBdisp\->v_len\fR properties of implicit keys are non\-zero, the sum may exceed it\.\fR This might be relevant or irrelevant depending on your code\.

.SS "OTHER GLOBAL SETTINGS"
Besides the two global variables \fBINI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_VALUE\fR and \fBINI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_V_LEN\fR, a third variable named \fBINI_GLOBAL_LOWERCASE_MODE\fR tells \fBlibconfini\fR whether to dispatch in lower case all key names and section paths of case\-insensitive INI files\.
.
.P
As with the other global variables, you can declare the variable \fBINI_GLOBAL_LOWERCASE_MODE\fR at the beginning of your code:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

#include <stdbool\.h>
#include <confini\.h>

bool INI_GLOBAL_LOWERCASE_MODE = false;
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
or assign a value to it at the beginning of your \fBmain()\fR function:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

#include <stdbool\.h>
#include <confini\.h>

int main () {

  INI_GLOBAL_LOWERCASE_MODE = true;

  /* \.\.\. */

}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Alternatively, this variable can be set by using its setter function \fBini_global_set_lowercase_mode()\fR\.
.
.P
When the variable \fBINI_GLOBAL_LOWERCASE_MODE\fR is set to \fBtrue\fR, \fBlibconfini\fR always dispatches in lower case \fIall\fR ASCII letters of key and section names in case\-insensitive formats – \fIeven when these are enclosed within quotes\fR – but does \fBnot\fR dispatch in lower case UTF\-8 code points out of the ASCII range (for instance, \fBĀ\fR will not be rendered as \fBā\fR, but will be rendered verbatim)\. \fIIn general it is a good practice to use UTF\-8 within values, but to use ASCII only within key and section names, at least in case insensitive INI files\fR (see below)\. As for the dispatched values instead, their case is always preserved\.
.
.P
Normally \fBINI_GLOBAL_LOWERCASE_MODE\fR does not need to be set to \fBtrue\fR, since string comparisons made by libconfini are always either case\-sensitive or case\-insensitive depending on the format given\.
.
.SS "THE UNICODE PROBLEM"
Comparing an ASCII upper case letter to an ASCII lower case letter is an invariant process\. But comparing two Unicode letter cases is a process that depends on the locale of the machine\. Consider for example the lower case letter \fBi\fR: in most European languages its upper case is \fBI\fR, while this is not the case in Turkish, where the upper case of \fBi\fR is \fBİ\fR (and the lower case of \fBI\fR is \fBı\fR)\. Therefore for a person living in Italy or France, \fBi\fR and \fBI\fR will represent the same letter, while for a person living in Turkey they will not\.
.
.P
Key and section names of an INI file however cannot depend on the locale of the machine, since they must be reliably searched for independently of where a machine is located\. Imagine for example a key named “INI” and imagine that Unicode case folding were performed on key names during string comparisons\. If you lived in Europe you could look up for such key using its lower case “ini”, while if you lived in Turkey you would have to use the lower case “ını” to find it\. So the only solution in this context is to consider Unicode characters out of the ASCII range always as case sensitive\. For this reason, \fBlibconfini\fR (and probably any senseful INI parser) will never perform case folding of Unicode characters out of the ASCII range within key and section names\.
.
.P
It must be said however that most Unicode characters do not possess a lower and upper case, and most characters outside of the ASCII range could theoretically appear without problems in key and section names also in case insensitive INI files (think of the character \fB§\fR for example)\. And, as for case sensitive INI files, no Unicode character would ever represent a problem\. Nonetheless, it is still generally more acceptable to use ASCII only within key and section names – and possibly, if needed, non\-ASCII Unicode characters within values and comments\.
.
.P
That said, \fBlibconfini\fR deals perfectly fine with UTF\-8 (but is always case sensitive outside of the ASCII range), so use the latter as you feel appropriate\.
.
.SS "THREAD SAFETY"
Depending on the format of the INI file, \fBlibconfini\fR may use up to three global variables (\fBINI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_VALUE\fR, \fBINI_GLOBAL_IMPLICIT_V_LEN\fR and \fBINI_GLOBAL_LOWERCASE_MODE\fR)\. In order to be thread\-safe these three variables (if needed) must be defined only once (either directly, or by using their setter functions \fBini_global_set_implicit_value()\fR and \fBini_global_set_lowercase_mode()\fR), or otherwise a mutex logic must be introduced\.
.
.P
Apart from the three variables above, each parsing allocates and frees its own memory and every function is fully reentrant, therefore the library can be considered thread\-safe\.
.
.SS "ERROR EXCEPTIONS"
The philosophy of \fBlibconfini\fR is to parse as much as possible without generating error exceptions\. No parsing errors are returned once an INI file has been correctly allocated into the stack, with the exception of the \fIout\-of\-range\fR error \fBCONFINI_EOOR\fR (see \fBenum\fR \fBConfiniInterruptNo\fR), whose meaning is that the dispatches are for unknown reasons more than expected – this error is possibly generated by the presence of bugs in the library\'s code and should never be returned (please contact me \fIhttps://github\.com/madmurphy/libconfini/issues\fR if this happens)\.
.
.P
When an INI node is wrongly written in respect to the format given, it is dispatched verbatim as an \fBINI_UNKNOWN\fR node – see \fBenum\fR \fBIniNodeType\fR\. Empty lines, or lines containing only spaces and empty quotes (if the latter are supported) will be skipped\.
.
.P
In order to avoid error exceptions, strings containing an unterminated quote will always be treated as if they had a virtual quote as their last + 1 character\. For example,
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

foo = "bar
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
will always determine the same behavior as if it were
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

foo = "bar"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "PERFORMANCE"
The algorithms used by \fBlibconfini\fR stand in a delicate equilibrium between flexibility, speed and code readability, with flexibility as primary target\. Performance can vary with the format used to parse an INI file, but in most cases is not a concern\.
.
.P
One can measure the performance of the library by doing something like:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

/*  tests/performance/performance\.c  */

#include <stdio\.h>
#include <confini\.h>
#include <time\.h>

static int get_ini_size (IniStatistics * stats, void * v_bytes) {

  *((size_t *) v_bytes) = stats\->bytes;

  return 0;

}

static int empty_listener (IniDispatch * dispatch, void * v_bytes) {

  return 0;

}

int main () {

  size_t bytes;
  double seconds;
  clock_t start, end;
  start = clock();

  /*  Please create an INI file large enough  */
  if (load_ini_path(
    "big_file\.ini",
    INI_DEFAULT_FORMAT,
    get_ini_size,
    empty_listener,
    &bytes
  )) {

    return 1;

  }

  end = clock();
  seconds = (double) (end \- start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

  printf(
    "%zu bytes parsed in %f seconds\.\en"
    "Number of bytes parsed per second: %f\en",
    bytes, seconds, bytes / seconds
  );

  return 0;

}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
By changing the format of the INI file on the code above you may obtain different results\. In particular, switching disabled entry recognition off – by setting \fBIniFormat::semicolon_marker\fR and \fBIniFormat::hash_marker\fR to \fBINI_ONLY_COMMENT\fR or \fBINI_IGNORE\fR – and making the format non\-multi\-line – by setting \fBIniFormat::multiline_nodes\fR to \fBINI_NO_MULTILINE\fR – will have a positive impact on the performance\.
.
.P
On my old laptop \fBlibconfini\fR seems to parse around 23 MiB per second using the model format \fBINI_DEFAULT_FORMAT\fR\. Whether this is enough for you or not, that depends on your needs\.

\fI\fBAddendum:\fR Unfortunately that old computer broke, so now I can perform tests only on a newer hardware, where \fBlibconfini\fR seems to parse four times as fast\. But if you are interested in testing yourself the performance of this library on a particular hardware, I have left a performance test under \fBtests/performance\fR\.\fR
.
.SS "COMPILING FOR EXTREME PLATFORMS"
This library has nearly everything implemented from scratch, with the only notable exception of the I/O functions \fBload_ini_file()\fR and \fBload_ini_path()\fR, which rely on C standard libraries\. On some platforms, however, only a rather exotic I/O API is available, while for some other platforms the C Standard Library is simply too heavy or just not implementable\.
.
.P
The official build environment of \fBlibconfini\fR does not offer shortcuts for facing this kind of situations\. But fortunately, thanks to the modularity of the source code, it is very simple to get rid of every tie with the C Standard Library and compile \fBlibconfini\fR as “bare metal”, with \fBstrip_ini_cache()\fR as the only parsing function (as this relies only on a buffer for its input) – i\.e\. without \fBload_ini_file()\fR and \fBload_ini_path()\fR, and without any header at all\.
.
.P
To do so, follow these simple steps:
.
.IP "1." 4
Remove \fBinclude <stdio\.h>\fR and \fBinclude <stdint\.h>\fR from \fBconfini\.h\fR
.
.IP "2." 4
Remove \fBinclude <stdlib\.h>\fR from \fBconfini\.c\fR
.
.IP "3." 4
Remove the functions \fBload_ini_file()\fR and \fBload_ini_path()\fR from both \fBconfini\.h\fR and \fBconfini\.c\fR
.
.IP "4." 4
Remove the function pointers \fBini_get_int\fR, \fBini_get_lint\fR, \fBini_get_llint\fR and \fBini_get_double\fR from both \fBconfini\.h\fR and \fBconfini\.c\fR (from now on you will have to provide your own functions for converting strings to numbers – for possible replacements please see: @ref hacking)
.
.IP "5." 4
Create a \fBtypedef\fR in \fBconfini\.h\fR for each of the following data types: \fBsize_t\fR, \fBint8_t\fR, \fBuint8_t\fR, \fBuint16_t\fR and \fBuint32_t\fR
.
.IP "6." 4
Leave everything else as it is
.
.IP "" 0

After doing so \fBlibconfini\fR will work even without a kernel\.
.
.SH "INI SYNTAX CONSIDERATIONS"
.
.SS "COMMENT OR DISABLED ENTRY?"
I can hardly imagine a reason to be interested in disabled entries if not for writing a GUI editor for INI files\. However, if this is the case and you are not using \fBlibconfini\fR like normal people do, you might wonder how to ensure that disabled entries and comments be always parsed without ambiguity\.
.
.P
In most of the cases \fBlibconfini\fR is smart enough to distinguish a disabled entry from a comment\. However some INI files can be tricky and might require some workarounds\. For instance, imagine to have the following INI file:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# INI key/value delimiter: `=`

[some_section]

hello = world

;foo = bar

##now=Sunday April 3rd, 2016
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
And imagine that for unknown reasons the author of the INI file wanted only \fB;foo = bar\fR to be considered as a disabled entry, and the first and last line as normal comments\.
.
.P
If we tried to parse it according to the format used below
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

#include <stdio\.h>
#include <confini\.h>

static int ini_listener (IniDispatch * disp, void * v_null) {

  printf(
    "#%zu \- TYPE: %u, DATA: \'%s\', VALUE: \'%s\'\en",
    disp\->dispatch_id, disp\->type, disp\->data, disp\->value
  );

  return 0;

    \.delimiter_symbol = INI_EQUALS,
    \.case_sensitive = NO,

    \.hash_marker = INI_IS_NOT_A_MARKER,
    \.multiline_nodes = INI_NO_MULTILINE,

.P
As you can see, all comments but \fBnow=Sunday April 3rd, 2016\fR would be parsed as disabled entries – which is not what the author intended\. Therefore, to ensure that such INI file be parsed properly, you can follow two possible approaches\.
.
.P
\fB1\. Intervene on the INI file\.\fR The reason why \fBnow=Sunday April 3rd, 2016\fR has been properly parsed as a comment – despite it really looks like a disabled entry – is because it has been nested within a comment block opened by more than one leading comment marker (in this case the two \fB#\fR)\. As a general rule, \fI\fBlibconfini\fR never parses a comment beginning with more than one leading marker as a disabled entry\fR, therefore this is the surest way to ensure that proper comments are always considered as such\.
.
.P
Hence, by adding one more number sign to the first comment
.
.IP "" 4

[some_section]

we obtain the wanted result:

.

.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
\fB2\. Intervene on the format\.\fR There are cases where the INI file is automatically generated by machines (comments included), or distributed as such, and human intervention would be required on each machine\-generated realease of the INI file\. In these cases – and if we are sure about the expected content of the INI file – we can restrict the format chosen in order to parse comments and disabled entries properly\. In particular, the following fields of the \fBIniFormat\fR bitfield can have an impact on the disambiguation between comments and disabled entries\.
.
.P
Reliable general patterns:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBIniFormat::semicolon_marker\fR and \fBIniFormat::hash_marker\fR – The imaginary author of our INI file, if we observe the latter closer, chose the semicolon symbol as the marker of disabled entries and the hash symbol as the marker of comments\. We may exploit this difference and set our \fBmy_format\.semicolon_marker\fR to \fBINI_DISABLED_OR_COMMENT\fR and our \fBmy_format\.hash_marker\fR to \fBINI_ONLY_COMMENT\fR to obtain the correct disambiguation\. If you believe that this solution is too artificial, think that \fB/etc/samba/smb\.conf\fR and \fB/etc/pulse/daemon\.conf\fR are systematically distributed using this pattern\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBIniFormat::disabled_after_space\fR – Setting this property to \fBfalse\fR, due to the initial space that follows the comment marker (\fB# INI\.\.\.\fR), forces the entire line to be considered as a comment\. Some authors use this syntax to distinguish between comments and disabled entries (examples are \fB/etc/pacman\.conf\fR and \fB/etc/bluetooth/main\.conf\fR)
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Temporary workarounds:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBIniFormat::no_spaces_in_names\fR – If our INI file has only comments containing more than one word and we are sure that key and section names cannot contain internal white spaces, we can set this property to \fBtrue\fR to enhance disambiguation\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBIniFormat::disabled_can_be_implicit\fR – This property, if set to \fBfalse\fR, forces all comments that do not contain a key\-value delimiter never to be considered as disabled entries\. Despite not having an impact on our example, it has an impact on the disambiguation algorithms used by \fBlibconfini\fR\. Its value in \fBINI_DEFAULT_FORMAT\fR is set to \fBfalse\fR\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
As a general rule, \fBlibconfini\fR will always try to parse as a disabled entry whatever comment is allowed (by the format) to contain one\. Only if this attempt fails, the block will be dispatched as a normal comment\.
