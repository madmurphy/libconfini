libconfini {#install}
=====================


Unix
----

On most Unix-like systems, you should be able to install **libconfini** using
the following common steps:

    ./configure
    make
    make install-strip

If the `strip` utility is not available on your machine, use `make install`
instead (it will produce larger binaries)

For a minimum installation without development files (i.e. static libraries,
headers, documentation, examples, etc.) use `./configure --disable-devel`. If
you only want to leave out man pages and examples, use `./configure
--disable-doc --disable-examples`.

If you need to customize the target directories, or otherwise adjust the build
setting, use

    ./configure --help

to list the configure options.

After running the `configure` script you can print the list of commonly used
targets by launching `make help`.

If the `configure` script is missing from your package you need to create it by
running the `bootstrap` script. Use the `--noconfigure` parameter to prevent
`bootstrap` from running automatically the `configure` script immediately after
having generated it. To list different options use `./bootstrap --help`.

If both the `configure` and `bootstrap` scripts are missing you can initialize
the build environment by launching the following commands from the source
directory:

    libtoolize
    aclocal
    automake --add-missing --copy --gnu
    autoconf
    ./configure

Or you can use a more modern approach and launch directly:

    mkdir m4
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure


Microsoft Windows
-----------------


### MinGW

If you are using Microsoft Windows, a batch script for compiling **libconfini**
under MinGW without GNU Make is available (`mgwmake.bat`). If you want instead
to compile the library manually, you can run:

    cd src
    windres.exe -i winres.rc -o winres.o
    gcc.exe -std=c99 -g -O3 -Wall -shared -static-libgcc -Wl,--no-undefined \
        -Wl,-out-implib,libconfini.lib -o libconfini.dll winres.o confini.c
    strip.exe libconfini.dll

If you want to generate also the `.def` file, use:

    cd src
    windres.exe -i winres.rc -o winres.o
    gcc -c -o confini.o confini.c
    dlltool.exe -z libconfini.def -D libconfini --export-all-symbols confini.o
    gcc.exe -std=c99 -g -O3 -Wall -shared -static-libgcc -Wl,--no-undefined \
        -Wl,-out-implib,libconfini.lib -o libconfini.dll confini.o winres.o
    strip.exe libconfini.dll

If you want to build (and install) **libconfini** via GNU Make under Microsoft
Windows several options are available, such as MinGW + MSYS, MSYS2, GnuWin32
and Cygwin (for which [an unofficial port][1] of **libconfini** exists).


### Microsoft Visual Studio

To compile the library with Microsoft Visual Studio use the following commands:

    cd src
    rc.exe winres.rc
    cl.exe /c /O2 confini.c
    link /DLL /DEF:libconfini.def /OUT:libconfini.dll winres.res confini.obj

To compile it as a static library use:

    cd src
    rc.exe winres.rc
    cl.exe /c /O2 confini.c
    lib.exe /OUT:libconfini.lib winres.res confini.obj

In both cases, to test the library with a simple program named `my_test.c` you
can launch:

    cl.exe my_test.c /link libconfini.lib

The library is written in standard C99; however MSVC uses a non-standard
semantics to access the `.data` segment of a shared library. Accordingly, after
having generated the DLL file, to access its global variables you will need to
replace all occurrences of the `extern` keyword with the special
`__declspec(dllimport)` keyword in the library's header included in your
program. This can be easily done using the C Preprocessor:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
/*  my_test.c  */

#pragma push_macro("extern")
#undef extern
#define extern __declspec(dllimport)
#include <confini.h>
#pragma pop_macro("extern")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code above will work if you are using the library in a C program. But, as
the macro will affect also the language-specific directive `extern "C"`, it
will not work under C++. In this last case you will have to edit the header by
hand and place the above macro inside `extern "C" { ... }`. This workaround is
not required with more standard-compliant compilers, such as GCC, where the
standard `extern` keyword is used to access a shared `.data` segment.


### Precompiled DLL

Often a compiled DLL [is available][2] among the assets of each release of this
package on GitHub.


Bare metal
----------

The library has almost everything implemented from scratch, with the only
notable exception of the I/O functions `load_ini_file()` and `load_ini_path()`,
which rely on C standard libraries. On some platforms, however, only a rather
exotic I/O API is available, while for some other platforms the C Standard
Library is simply too heavy or just not implementable.

In these situations it will be needed to get rid of every tie with the C
Standard Library and compile **libconfini** as "bare metal". The `configure`
script has a `--without-io-api` option that allows to create a special fork of
the original library able to function in any environment. For information about
how to proceed, please see `dev/hackings/baremetal/README.md`.


Complex installations
---------------------

This package has been designed to be able to coexist with other major releases
of itself. However, when two versions share the same major number but have
different minor or revision numbers, only the most recent package must be
installed.

For two or more different major releases to be able to coexist, the major
number of each version must be appended to the package name it refers to, with
the possible exception of only one package (usually version 1.X.X). This can be
done easily by passing the `--with-other-versions` option to the `configure`
script:

    ./configure --with-other-versions

This will ensure **libconfini** X.Y.Z to be installed as **libconfiniX** X.Y.Z.

There are different views concerning which package name should be the only
unnumbered one. According to some conventions the major version number is
appended to the package names of all major version greater than one, while
according to other conventions the the major version number is appended to the
package names of all versions that are older than the current version.

If you want to install a modified version of **libconfini** without generating
conflicts with an original version already present in the system, or you simply
want to install **libconfini** under a different name, you can use [Autoconf
transforming rules][3]. In particular, to prepend a prefix to the library name,
use `./configure --program-prefix=[PREFIX]`; to append a suffix, use
`./configure --program-suffix=[SUFFIX]`; to perform a `sed` substitution, use
`./configure --program-transform-name="s/[OLDTEXT]/[NEWTEXT]/[g]"`. Note that
the `lib` prefix at the beginning of the library name is always preserved (for
instance, `./configure --program-transform-name="s/^.*$/hello/"` will rename
the package to "libhello"). If you specify a prefix and/or a suffix together
with a `sed` substitution, the latter will be performed after the former have
been concatenated to the original name.

Do not use Autoconf transforming rules in place of the built-in `./configure
--with-other-versions` for appending the major version number to the name of
the package. If you do so, the header file will be installed as `confiniX.h`,
instead of the more standard `confini-X.h`.

Distributing the source code
----------------------------

If you aim to re-distribute the source code of **libconfini** you should first
make sure that the `configure` script is present, for granting the possibility
to compile the package without having Autotools installed. If the `configure`
script is present and you have already launched it, use `make distclean` to
reset the configuration that this has created, or use `make source-release` to
build a fresh archive that ignores the current configuration.


Distributing the compiled package
---------------------------------

Use `make binary-release` to create a binary package of **libconfini** for a
particular platform. If you want to obtain the list of the files that are going
to be installed, use `make manifest`.
